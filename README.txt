ABSTRACT

Scales elements to keep their height less than that of the viewport.


TODO

* Documentation
* Browser compatibility testing
* Optimize
* Features
    - add a class to images that are scaled, to allow styling, e.g. cursor to indicate togglability
    - consider adding option for a lightboxish overlay behind images when toggled to original size, to make it more obvious what is going on
